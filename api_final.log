DEBUG: LLM Content: 'The Anthropic Economic Index Report, authored by Ruth Appel, Maxim Massenkoff, and Peter McCrory, along with Miles McCain, Ryan Heller, Tyler Neylon, and Alex Tamkin, introduces the concept of "economic primitives." These primitives are foundational characteristics that illustrate how AI, specifically Claude, is being used by both consumers and firms.

This fourth edition of the report expands upon prior reports by adding new economic primitives beyond collaboration patterns (automation/augmentation). The strength of the index lies in showing not only the extent of AI usage but also the specific ways it is being utilized. These measures, while individual classifications may be imperfect, are directionally accurate and collectively provide significant insights into labor market shifts. The selection of these primitives was based on their expected economic relevance, complementarity of dimensions, and Claude's ability to classify conversations along those dimensions with directional accuracy.'
